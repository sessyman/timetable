This is a manual timetable builder. Drag and drop the data from data section 
into the table. Every element will be placed in the selected slot. When a clash
exists, an error message is shown. If there's no clash and the teacher is made
to take the same class more than once in a day, a warning is shown, but the
slot will be placed in the target cell. Contribute some additional code, or test
and suggest modifications
